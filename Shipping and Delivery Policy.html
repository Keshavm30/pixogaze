        <h1>Shipping and Delivery Policy - Pixogaze</h1>
        <h2>1. Delivery of Digital Products</h2>
        <p>As a photography service provider, Pixogaze delivers final products (images, videos, etc.) in a digital format:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delivery Method:</strong> Completed projects will be delivered electronically via email, cloud storage links (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), or a private client portal on our website.</li>
            <li><strong>Delivery Timeline:</strong> We aim to deliver the final edited images within 3-7 business days after the photoshoot, unless otherwise specified in the contract or booking confirmation. In case of video shoots, the timeline may extend depending on the complexity of the project.</li>
            <li><strong>Rush Delivery:</strong> If you need expedited delivery, please contact us in advance. Additional fees may apply for rush orders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Physical Deliverables (If Applicable)</h2>
        <p>In rare cases where Pixogaze offers physical products such as printed photos, albums, or merchandise:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shipping Method:</strong> Physical products will be shipped via a reputable courier service. Shipping fees will be included in the final invoice, unless otherwise agreed.</li>

            <li><strong>Shipping Timeframe:</strong> Once shipped, physical products are expected to arrive within 7-14 business days, depending on your location. Delays due to holidays or unforeseen circumstances may affect delivery times.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> A tracking number will be provided once your order is dispatched. You can use this to monitor the status of your delivery.</li>
        </ul>
