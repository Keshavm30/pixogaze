        <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy - Pixogaze</h1>
        <h2>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>At Pixogaze, we understand that sometimes plans change. Our cancellation policy is designed to accommodate
            both parties while ensuring fairness:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advance Notice:</strong> Clients may cancel their bookings by providing at least 24 hours'
                notice before the scheduled session time.</li>
            <li><strong>Late Cancellations:</strong> If you cancel with less than 24 hours' notice, Pixogaze reserves
                the right to charge a cancellation fee of up to 50% of the total booking amount.</li>
            <li><strong>Same-Day Cancellations:</strong> In case of a same-day cancellation or a no-show, 100% of the
                total booking fee will be charged.</li>
            <li><strong>Rescheduling:</strong> You may reschedule your session without incurring additional fees by
                providing a minimum of 24 hours' notice. Rescheduling requests made within less than 24 hours may be
                subject to a fee depending on the circumstances.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Refunds will be processed according to the following guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eligibility for Refunds:</strong> Refunds will be granted if a cancellation request is received
                at least 24 hours before the scheduled session. In such cases, Pixogaze will refund the full booking
                amount.</li>
            <li><strong>Late Cancellations:</strong> If the booking is cancelled with less than 24 hours' notice, a
                partial refund (50% of the total amount) may be issued. No refunds will be granted for same-day
                cancellations or no-shows.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Issues or Service Failure:</strong> In the unlikely event that Pixogaze fails to
                provide the agreed services due to technical issues or unforeseen circumstances, a full refund will be
                issued, or the session will be rescheduled at no additional cost to the client.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Refundable Charges:</strong> Any third-party charges or service fees (e.g., payment gateway
                fees) incurred during the booking process are non-refundable.</li>
        </ul>
